# Clay Modeling App - Requirements

## Overview
An Android application that allows users to create 3D models using virtual clay manipulation tools, with the ability to save and load models for 3D printing.

## User Stories & Requirements

### Core Modeling

**US-1: Initial Clay Sphere**
- As a user, I want to start with a sphere of virtual clay so I can begin sculpting immediately

WHEN the user opens the app or creates a new model
THE SYSTEM SHALL display a 3D sphere of virtual clay in the center of the viewport

WHEN the sphere is displayed
THE SYSTEM SHALL allow the user to rotate and zoom the view using touch gestures

**US-2: Remove Clay Tool**
- As a user, I want to remove clay from the model so I can carve and shape it

WHEN the user selects the "Remove Clay" tool
THE SYSTEM SHALL allow the user to touch the model surface to remove clay

WHEN the user touches and drags on the model surface
THE SYSTEM SHALL remove clay along the drag path with configurable brush size

WHEN clay is removed
THE SYSTEM SHALL update the 3D mesh in real-time

**US-3: Add Clay Tool**
- As a user, I want to add clay to the model so I can build up features

WHEN the user selects the "Add Clay" tool
THE SYSTEM SHALL allow the user to touch the model surface to add clay

WHEN the user touches and drags on the model surface
THE SYSTEM SHALL add clay along the drag path with configurable brush size

WHEN clay is added
THE SYSTEM SHALL blend the new clay smoothly with the existing surface

**US-4: Pull Clay Tool**
- As a user, I want to pull clay outward so I can create protrusions and details

WHEN the user selects the "Pull Clay" tool
THE SYSTEM SHALL allow the user to touch and drag the model surface

WHEN the user drags on the surface
THE SYSTEM SHALL pull the clay in the direction of the drag

WHEN clay is pulled
THE SYSTEM SHALL maintain smooth surface transitions

### View Manipulation

**US-5: Camera Controls**
- As a user, I want to view my model from any angle so I can work on all sides

WHEN the user performs a single-finger drag gesture
THE SYSTEM SHALL rotate the camera around the model

WHEN the user performs a pinch gesture
THE SYSTEM SHALL zoom the camera in or out

WHEN the user performs a two-finger drag gesture
THE SYSTEM SHALL pan the camera position

### Tool Configuration

**US-6: Brush Size Control**
- As a user, I want to adjust tool size so I can work on both large areas and fine details

WHEN the user accesses tool settings
THE SYSTEM SHALL display a brush size slider

WHEN the user adjusts the brush size
THE SYSTEM SHALL update the tool's affected area immediately

WHEN the user applies a tool
THE SYSTEM SHALL use the configured brush size

**US-7: Tool Strength Control**
- As a user, I want to adjust tool strength so I can make subtle or dramatic changes

WHEN the user accesses tool settings
THE SYSTEM SHALL display a strength slider

WHEN the user adjusts the strength
THE SYSTEM SHALL affect how much clay is added/removed/pulled per interaction

**US-8: View Mode**
- As a user, I want a view-only mode so I can examine my model without accidentally modifying it

WHEN the user selects the "View" tool
THE SYSTEM SHALL disable all editing tools

WHEN the user is in view mode
THE SYSTEM SHALL allow pinch to zoom (0.5x to 5x)

WHEN the user is in view mode
THE SYSTEM SHALL allow single-finger drag to rotate around the model center

WHEN the user is in view mode
THE SYSTEM SHALL allow two-finger drag to pan the camera

WHEN the user double-taps in view mode
THE SYSTEM SHALL reset the camera to default position

WHEN the user is in view mode
THE SYSTEM SHALL display the current zoom level

WHEN the user is in view mode
THE SYSTEM SHALL keep the clay model centered as the pivot point for all rotations

### Save & Load

**US-9: Save Model**
- As a user, I want to save my work so I can continue later or export for printing

WHEN the user selects "Save Model"
THE SYSTEM SHALL prompt for a filename

WHEN the user confirms the save
THE SYSTEM SHALL store the model data to device storage

WHEN the save is complete
THE SYSTEM SHALL display a confirmation message

**US-10: Load Model**
- As a user, I want to load previously saved models so I can continue working on them

WHEN the user selects "Load Model"
THE SYSTEM SHALL display a list of saved models

WHEN the user selects a model from the list
THE SYSTEM SHALL load the model and display it in the viewport

WHEN the model fails to load
THE SYSTEM SHALL display an error message and maintain the current model

**US-11: Export for 3D Printing**
- As a user, I want to export my model as an STL file so I can 3D print it

WHEN the user selects "Export STL"
THE SYSTEM SHALL convert the model to STL format

WHEN the export is complete
THE SYSTEM SHALL save the STL file to the device's Downloads folder

WHEN the export is complete
THE SYSTEM SHALL display the file location to the user

### User Interface

**US-12: Tool Selection**
- As a user, I want easy access to all tools so I can switch between them quickly

WHEN the app is running
THE SYSTEM SHALL display a toolbar with all available tools

WHEN the user taps a tool icon
THE SYSTEM SHALL activate that tool and highlight it visually

**US-13: Undo/Redo**
- As a user, I want to undo mistakes so I can experiment freely

WHEN the user performs a modeling action
THE SYSTEM SHALL add the action to the undo history

WHEN the user taps "Undo"
THE SYSTEM SHALL revert the last action

WHEN the user taps "Redo"
THE SYSTEM SHALL reapply the last undone action

WHEN there are no actions to undo/redo
THE SYSTEM SHALL disable the respective button

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

**US-14: Core Logic Testing**
- As a developer, I want comprehensive unit tests so I can refactor with confidence

WHEN unit tests are executed
THE SYSTEM SHALL test all ClayModel mesh manipulation methods

WHEN unit tests are executed
THE SYSTEM SHALL test all Tool implementations (RemoveClayTool, AddClayTool, PullClayTool)

WHEN unit tests are executed
THE SYSTEM SHALL test FileManager save/load/export functionality

WHEN unit tests are executed
THE SYSTEM SHALL validate .clay file format correctness (magic number, version, checksum, data integrity)

WHEN unit tests are executed
THE SYSTEM SHALL validate STL file format correctness (header, triangle count, normals, byte order)

WHEN unit tests are executed
THE SYSTEM SHALL test round-trip save/load preserves model data

WHEN unit tests are executed
THE SYSTEM SHALL test STL export produces valid 3D printing files

WHEN unit tests are executed
THE SYSTEM SHALL test ViewModel state management and undo/redo logic

WHEN unit tests are executed
THE SYSTEM SHALL achieve at least 80% code coverage for business logic

### Integration Tests

**US-15: Workflow Testing**
- As a developer, I want integration tests so I can verify end-to-end functionality

WHEN integration tests are executed
THE SYSTEM SHALL test the complete save and load workflow

WHEN integration tests are executed
THE SYSTEM SHALL test the complete STL export workflow

WHEN integration tests are executed
THE SYSTEM SHALL test tool application with model state changes

WHEN integration tests are executed
THE SYSTEM SHALL test undo/redo with multiple operations

### CI/CD Pipeline

**US-16: Automated Quality Checks**
- As a developer, I want automated CI checks so code quality is maintained

WHEN code is pushed to the repository
THE SYSTEM SHALL run Kotlin lint checks

WHEN code is pushed to the repository
THE SYSTEM SHALL run all unit tests

WHEN code is pushed to the repository
THE SYSTEM SHALL run all integration tests that don't require a physical device

WHEN code is pushed to the repository
THE SYSTEM SHALL fail the build if any test fails or lint errors exist

WHEN code is pushed to the repository
THE SYSTEM SHALL generate and upload test coverage reports

## Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR-1: Performance**

THE SYSTEM SHALL maintain at least 30 FPS during manipulation

**NFR-2: Model Complexity**
THE SYSTEM SHALL support models with at least 50,000 vertices without performance degradation

**NFR-3: Android Compatibility**
THE SYSTEM SHALL run on Android 8.0 (API level 26) and above

**NFR-4: File Size**
WHEN saving models
THE SYSTEM SHALL compress data to minimize storage usage

**NFR-5: Test Coverage**
THE SYSTEM SHALL have unit tests covering at least 80% of business logic code

THE SYSTEM SHALL have integration tests for all critical user workflows

**NFR-6: Code Quality**
